"""Harness Context Compaction Protocol. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-31-harness-context-compaction-protocol-design.md.

Two distinct artifacts sharing only _gather_snapshot():
  - checkpoint(): AST-grounded resumption-ledger write (reactive, manual or
    auto_checkpoint_on_pack-triggered)
  - pack()/inject(): proactive task-boundary context-pack injection

There is no 75%-threshold reactive monitor -- no cross-harness context-usage
signal exists anywhere in synlynk's own data, confirmed during brainstorming.

Ships unconditionally in v0.26.8/Dev Preview -- not registered against the
Configurability Framework, which is deferred to the "Expansion Capabilities"
goal. CONTEXT_COMPACTION_SETTINGS_SCHEMA is kept here so that framework can
register this feature retroactively once it exists.
